      <h1>Hey there üëã</h1>
      <p>I'm Jack! I'm a student, builder, entrepreneur, and explorer working at the intersection of machine learning, computational science, and hands-on engineering.</p>

      <p>I'm currently part of the Grazioli Research Group, where I work on machine learning simulations for computational chemistry and biophysics. Our goal is to accelerate scientific discovery through intelligent, data-driven models that can simulate the behavior of molecules and biological systems at the atomic level.</p>

      <p>Outside of the lab, I build things. I've designed and built drones from scratch, applying engineering principles across hardware and software to bring ideas to life. I also enjoy creating apps and experimenting with new technology, whether it's a tool to make life easier or a system to explore an interesting idea.</p>

      <p>This website exists for three main reasons:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1Ô∏è‚É£ To share my projects. Whether it's research from the lab, a custom-built drone, or a new app I'm excited about, I want to showcase what I'm building and learning.</li>
        <li>2Ô∏è‚É£ To explore and organize my ideas. As I continue to work across machine learning, chemistry, physics, and engineering, this site will act as a central place to track the evolution of my interests and insights.</li>
        <li>3Ô∏è‚É£ To connect with others. I'm always open to new conversations, collaborations, or feedback. Whether you're working in a similar field or just curious, feel free to reach out.</li>
